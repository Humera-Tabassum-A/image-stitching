### üß† **Project Title: Panoramic Image Stitching using Key Feature Matching**

### ‚úÖ **Objective:**

To create a seamless panoramic image by stitching multiple overlapping input images. This involves detecting distinctive features, matching them between images, and transforming the images to align and blend them into a single, wide-angle view.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Tools & Technologies Used:**

* **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** ‚Äì for feature detection, matching, and image transformations.
* **Python** ‚Äì for implementing the logic and automating the workflow.

### üß™ **Process Overview:**

1. **Image Acquisition**

   * Multiple overlapping images (e.g., landscape photos taken from left to right) are collected.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Images are resized and converted to grayscale (to speed up and simplify feature detection).

3. **Key Feature Detection**

   * Techniques like **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**, **SURF**, or **ORB** are used to detect robust, scale-invariant keypoints in each image.

4. **Feature Description & Matching**

   * Keypoints are described using feature vectors.
   * Feature matching is performed using **Brute Force Matcher** or **FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors)** to find corresponding points between images.

5. **Homography Estimation**

   * A transformation matrix (homography) is calculated using matched keypoints with **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** to eliminate outliers.
   * This matrix warps the perspective of images to align them.

6. **Image Warping & Stitching**

   * The images are warped and aligned to a common coordinate system using the homography.
   * Blending techniques (like feathering or multiband blending) are used to hide seams and exposure differences.

7. **Postprocessing**

   * Final cropping and smoothing to produce a high-quality, seamless panoramic image.

### üéØ **Result:**

* Successfully generated a **high-resolution panoramic image** by stitching multiple input images.
* Achieved good alignment, minimal distortion, and seamless blending using robust feature matching and homography transformation.
